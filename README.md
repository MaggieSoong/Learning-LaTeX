This is an interactive Jupyter notebook to be used for an introduction to $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ (equations) as rendered in Markdown. please read through the (already rendered) cells of text, and execute cells wherever indicated. 

To execute a cell when prompted, do:
1. **Highlight** the cell (you can do this either by clicking on it or using arrow keys to navigate).
2. Once you have highlighted the cell, **run it!** (use Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter, or use the "Run" button in the panel above).

(You may need to change the cell's format from Python to Markdown)
